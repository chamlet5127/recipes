This is a recipe for guacamole, it's highly adjustable.

2 ripe avocados
1 tbsp lime juice
1/4 minced onions
1 serrano seeded and minced
1 small tomato seeded and chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Cut the avocado in half and remove the seed. Gently score the avocado inside the peel
to cut into small cuboids (don't cut yourself!) Scoop out the cuboids into a large bowl.
Roughly mash the avocados, add the salt and lime, mash a bit more (not too much if you
want chunky guac. You want chunky guac). Add the rest and mash a bit more. Eat on everything.

I didn't add cilantro because my husband detests it and I don't think it add much. You can
add it if you want.
